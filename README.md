Sustainable Product Advisor

The Sustainable Product Advisor is a multi-agent AI system designed to help users make environmentally conscious shopping decisions. It enables users to:

	* Discover eco-friendly alternatives to products
	* Analyze the environmental impact through Eco Scores
	* Receive recycling and reuse suggestions

The system is built with four agents:

	Recommendation Agent – Orchestrates the workflow and integrates results.

	Product Info Agent – Fetches detailed product information from external websites.

	Eco Score Calculator Agent – Evaluates the sustainability of products and assigns eco scores.

	Recycling Agent – Suggests recycling and disposal options.
